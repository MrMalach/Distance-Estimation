# Distance-Estimation
This short code demonstrates stereo vision.

<img src='/images/setup.jpg' width='200'>Two cameras are mounted in the same plane with measured distance in between.
Once the camera's focal length is known, similar triangle easily yield the distance to the object. 

The object in this case is a red LED.
